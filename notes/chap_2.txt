IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4. 32-bit address protocol responsible for the nework
layer.

IPv6: Internet Protocol version 6. 128-bit address protocol, succesor of the IPv4.

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol. Connection oriented protocol that provides
reliability and a full duplex byte stream to its users with no boundaries.

UDP: User Datagram Protocol. Connectionless protocol where packets are datagrams with
boundaries. It's unreliable because it doesn't guarantee that packets arrive to their
destination.

STCP: Stream Control Protocol. Connection oriented protocol that provides reliability
and a full duplex association. With association we mean that a STCP socket we can
address multiple IP's with the same host, also called as multihoming. Another difference
with TCP is that packets have boundaries. It can use IPv4, IPv6 or both.

ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol. This protocol handles error and control
information between routers and hosts. It is generated and processed by TCP, is not
meant to be used by users, it is a inter-protcol.

IGMP: Internet Group Message Protocol. Used with multicasting.

ICMPv6: Internet Control Message Protocol. Combines the functions of ICMPv4, IGMP and ARP.

ARP: Address Resolution Protocol. ARP maps IPv4 address into a hardware address MAC.
It's normally used in broadcasting.

RARP: Reverse Address Resolution Protocol. Maps MAC into IPv4.

BPF: BSD Packer filter. Interface that provides access to the datalink layer.

DLPI: Datalink Provider Interface. Interface that provides access to the datalink layer.
